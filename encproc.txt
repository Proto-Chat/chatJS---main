encryption procedures:

1. creation
	a. when creating an account, the user generates a public and private key
	b. a new encryption key is derived from the user's password
	b2. the salt is stored in plaintext in the DB
	c. the private key is then encrypted using the this new key and stored in the DB/locally
	d. create a key to encrypt all messages (we'll call it encKey)
	e. encrypt encKey using user A's public key and add it to obj
	f. encrypt encKey using user B's public key and add it to obj
	g. save both to DB

TODO: ENCRYPT THE PASSWORD
?. the password is encrypted SOMEHOW and stored in the DB
	
	?. the public key is stored in the DB unencrypted

2. access
	info: if the private key is not in the browser, the user must log out
	a. when logging in, the user's public key will be used to unencrypt their password to check
	b. the user will then be sent the private key, which has been encrypted using their password
	c. this will be stored in the browser's IndexDB
	d. when sending a message IN A DM, the user will encrypt it with their private key
	e. when a message is sent, the server will attatch the sender's public key
	f. when a message is recieved, the recipient will unencrypt it using the attached public key
